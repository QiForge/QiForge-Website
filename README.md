## 🪶 Founder’s Message

> QiForge was born from the simple joy of learning to build and publish something real.  
> My first website was a small portfolio made by following [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/c/SuperSimpleDev) — that project gave me the confidence to take the next step.  
>
> What started as a beginner’s experiment has now grown into a student-led innovation studio where creativity, collaboration, and code come together.  
>
> **QiForge** represents a mindset — that great things are forged, not found;  
> that with curiosity and persistence, even small beginnings can spark something extraordinary.
